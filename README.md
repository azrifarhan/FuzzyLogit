This Fuzzy Logistic Regression model is based on the one poposed by author ***Nimet Yapıcı Pehlivan*** & ***Aynur Yonar*** in the paper **An Integrated approach for fuzzy logistic regression (2018)**
The authors proposed using Fuzzy Least Sqaures method to estimate the parameters and uses triangular fuzzy numbers for both binary outcome
After estimating the parameters and transforming the fuzzy output into fuzzy possibility based on the extension principle, the centroid method was used to turn the output into crisp value.

NOTE: I am no where near to being competent when it comes to coding so I do apologize for the terrible naming conventions and inefficient use of variables. Leave a note for any fixes.
